Here’s a `README.md` template for your **Cafe-Management** project. It includes installation steps, project structure, and instructions to run each part of your project using `bun`.

# Cafe-Management

A comprehensive cafe management system built with:
- **Backend**: [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) for handling APIs.
- **Frontend Admin**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for admin panel and web interface.
- **Mobile App**: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for user interactions on mobile devices.
- **Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for fast JavaScript runtime and dependency management.

---

## Features
- **Backend**: Provides APIs for managing cafe operations such as menu, orders, and users.
- **Admin Panel**: A web-based dashboard to manage the cafe (Next.js).
- **Mobile App**: A React Native mobile app for customers to view menus and place orders.

---

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (version ≥ 18.x)
- **Bun** (version ≥ 0.7.x)  
  Install Bun:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cafe-Management.git
   cd Cafe-Management
   ```

2. Install dependencies for all parts of the project using `bun`:
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     bun install
     ```
   - **Frontend (Admin)**:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend/admin
     bun install
     ```
   - **Frontend (User)**:
     ```bash
     cd ../user
     bun install
     ```

---

## Running the Project
You can run the entire project using the interactive script `menu.js`. Use the following command from the root directory:
```bash
bun dev
```

You will see an interactive menu:
```
? Select an option:
  ❯ Backend
    Admin
    User
```

Select the appropriate option using arrow keys and press `Enter` to start the selected part of the project.

### Running Individual Parts
If you want to run each part manually:
- **Backend**:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  bun start
  ```
- **Frontend (Admin)**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend/admin
  bun dev
  ```
- **Frontend (User)**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend/user
  bun start
  ```

---

## Notes
- Make sure the database (if required by the backend) is set up and running before starting the backend server.
- For React Native, you may need to configure a mobile emulator or connect a physical device for testing.

---

## Suggestions
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive configuration like database URLs, API keys, and secrets in `.env` files.
   - Use tools like `dotenv` or Nest.js configuration modules for managing environment variables.
   
2. **Dockerization**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for each part of the project (backend, admin, user) and use Docker Compose to orchestrate them.

3. **CI/CD**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
